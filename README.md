LABSIP Python in PChem Community-of-Practice (PyCoP)
====================================================

Hello LABSIPers! 

This term LABSIP is launching a new Community of Practice on Python in Physical
Chemistry (PyCoP), which will bring together physical chemistry educators to
discuss and explore the techniques, applications, and pedagogical strategies
for integrating coding and other cyberinfrastructure (CI) tools/skills into the
physical chemistry curriculum.  While Python is in the name, our community will
be non-denominational—rather than getting lost in the syntactic & technical
details, we will primarily focus on the actual teaching practices that can
successfully support student cyberinfrastructure skill development within our
courses, as well as our target applications.  So even if you're not familiar
with coding or cyberinfrastructure tools, you're absolutely welcome to join us
and explore what's possible!

Because our community will be discussing the integration of coding & CI tools
into the physical chemistry classroom and lab, we will use this GitHub
repository as a natural platform to help centralize and deploy some of those
materials. 

## Meeting Schedule (Spring 2026)

To make sure PyCoP is broadly accessible to faculty with potentially
conflicting schedules, we will offer two parallel cohorts will meet on the
fourth Mondays (1:00pm-2:00pm ET) and Thursdays (1:30pm-2:30pm ET) of each
month. Because the Monday and Thursday cohorts are constructed to be
equivalent, please feel free to bounce between them if necessary for your
schedule! 

All meetings can be joined via the Zoom link below:

## Member Information Survey

If you are interested in participating in PyCoP, please take 10-15 minutes
before our first meetings next week to fill out the [member information
survey](https://forms.gle/onKBy2XkRPjM5ZYt5) so we can learn about you as a
member of our community:

I am greatly looking forward to our discussions this term and building this community with y'all!

Cheers,
