February Meeting: LiveCoding as an Instructional Framework
==========================================================

While chemistry degrees at some institutions do require a course in basic
programming as part of the curriculum, and sometimes students may have used
coding as part of another course (e.g., university physics, biostatistics,
etc.), the vast majority of students entering into physical chemistry have no
prior coding experience. If we are interested in applying coding and
cyberinfrastructure tools in our physical chemistry courses, we therefore must
be prepared to help students develop these skills from scratch. 

So, what are some effective pedagogies for to teaching coding specifically and
cyberinfrastructure skills more broadly?

During our first PyCoP meeting this term, Dom Sirianni will demonstrate and
discuss the _Live Coding_ pedagogical framework, which was developed and
popularized by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), a nonprofit
organization which has been teaching coding and cyberinfrastructure skills to
students, researchers, and professionals around the world since 1998.
Rather than a passive presentation, this discussion is meant to be actively 
participated in.
